# Configuration

The general configuration acts as a default setting, applied universally across all projects. This ensures a consistent baseline of settings for every project.

However, if users need to adapt to specific project requirements, they can do so by customizing the project-specific configuration. When changes are made at the project level, these settings override the general configuration for that particular project.

With project-specific configuration, settings can be customized for individual projects, ensuring that each project's unique requirements are met without affecting other projects. 

When a parameter is altered in the project-specific configuration, a label or indicator becomes visible. This label serves as a clear visual cue, signaling that the particular setting deviates from the general configuration.
